# 1. Binary — (Commonly known as “Add Binary”)

# Problem Statement:
# You are given two binary strings a and b.
# Return the sum of the two numbers as a binary string.

# Example:

# Input:  a = "11", b = "1"
# Output: "100"


# Constraints:

# 1 ≤ a.length, b.length ≤ 10⁴

# Each string contains only '0' or '1'.

# Strings do not contain leading zeros except the value "0".

# ✅ 2. Sum of Two Integers — (Commonly known as “Add Without + or -”)

# Problem Statement:
# Given two integers a and b, return their sum,
# but you are not allowed to use the operators + or -.

# You must compute the result using bitwise operations.

# Example:

# Input:  a = 1, b = 2
# Output: 3


# Constraints:

# -1000 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000 (may vary slightly depending on the platform)

# The result fits in a signed 32-bit integer.
