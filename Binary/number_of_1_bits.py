# Number of 1 Bits (LeetCode #191)

# Problem Statement:
# Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has.
# This count is also known as the Hamming weight.

# Example 1
# Input:  n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
# Output: 3


# Explanation:
# The input binary string has three '1' bits.

# Example 2
# Input:  n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
# Output: 1

# Example 3
# Input:  n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
# Output: 31

# Constraints

# The input must be treated as an unsigned integer.

# The input value fits in a 32-bit integer.
