# Missing Number
# Problem Statement

# Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

# Example 1

# Input:

# nums = [3, 0, 1]


# Output:

# 2


# Explanation:
# The numbers are in the range [0, 3].
# The number 2 is missing.

# Example 2

# Input:

# nums = [0, 1]


# Output:

# 2

# Example 3

# Input:

# nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]


# Output:

# 8

# Constraints

# n == nums.length

# 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴

# 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ n

# All numbers in nums are unique

# Follow-up

# Could you implement a solution using:

# O(n) time complexity

# O(1) extra space?
