# 🧩 Problem Statement: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

# You are given an array of unique integers that was originally sorted in ascending order, but then rotated at an unknown pivot index.

# Example of a rotated sorted array:

# Original sorted: [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]

# After rotation: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

# Your task is to find the minimum element in this array.

# Requirements

# The array has no duplicate elements.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

# ✔️ Input

# An integer array nums of length n, rotated at some pivot.

# ✔️ Output

# Return the minimum element in nums.

#  Example 1

# Input:
# nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
# Output:
# 1

# Explanation: The array was rotated at index 3.

#  Example 2

# Input:
# nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
# Output:
# 0

#  Example 3

# Input:
# nums = [11,13,15,17]
# Output:
# 11
# Explanation: The array is not rotated.
